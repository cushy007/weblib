CRUD philosophy
===============

During a Creation or Update phase, errors are happening at three different stages:
	1) on the page when submit is clicked: these errors are handled by the Web engine in accordance to the html attributes of the field (min, max, step, required...)
	2) on the posted form after validation by the Python code (form.validate()). The form is refused and the fields that do not compy to their validator function(s)
	  are displayed with an error message.
	3) at the modification of the DB (violated constraints). The form must be displayed again like at stage 2.
